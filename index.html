            <p class="body">This website is meant to showcase at least a little bit of what I've learned over my journey. This looks over the core three aspects I focused on; Development, Marketing, and Design. There will be individual sections that you can navigate through by using the bar at the top of the site.</p>

        <div class="container-fluid" id="main-para2">
            <p class="body">My previous experience with develpoment is minimal. For as long as I can remember, technology has always had my interest; but I never knew where to start to learn more. This was until last year, when I took the Programming class at Souhegan. This class covered an introduction to the programming language Python, one known for being introductory. Being taught by John Ranta that year was a great experience and excited me to learn more. Even though he retired that year, I chose pursue Advanced Programming to discover more. That class was way more individual and self-driven than I had anticipated, and so I went through a few ideas of what I wish to try and learn. I stumbled upon HTML and thought that I could create any possible ideas that came to me if I could learn the ins and outs of it, one of those ideas being a representation of what I’ve learned for an applied piece of a senior project. I may not have realized it at the time but that was going to be a big step for me, as web development can be quite tricky especially with ones ONLY background is of one year in Python. Whether this site shows absolutely everything I’ve learned in the most effective way or not, I’m still very pleased with my journey and what I’ve been able to learn.</p>
