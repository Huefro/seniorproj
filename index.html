            <p class="body">This website is meant to showcase at least a little bit of what I’ve learned over my journey. This looks over the core three aspects I focused on; Development, Marketing, and Design. There will be individual sections that you can navigate through by using the bar at the top of the site.</p>

        <h2 class="main_title"><i>My Background</i></h2>
        <div class="container-fluid" id="main-para2">
            <p class="body">
                My previous experience with develpoment is minimal. Going into this project, the only experience I had under my belt was gained last year, when I took the Programming class at Souhegan. This class covered an introduction to the programming language Python, known for being beginner-friendly. Being taught by John Ranta that year was a great experience and had me eager to learn more in the computer science field. It’s always intrigued me but I never ended up acting on that interest until my Junior year because I never quite knew where to start. </p><br>
            <p class="body">
                I chose pursue Advanced Programming the next year, and that class was way more individual and self-driven than I had anticipated. I was able to choose what programming language I wanted to learn and was in charge of how I learnt it. After going through a few ideas of what I wished to try and learn, I stumbled upon HTML. Trying to make my own website seemed like a neat way to expand my knowledge, so I took on the challenge. I didn’t realize it then, but it was going to be more tough and confusing than I thought. Whether this site shows absolutely everything I’ve learned in the most effective way or not, I’m still very pleased with my journey and what I’ve been able to learn.

        <h2 class="main_title"><i>Difference from presentation?</i></h2>
        <div class="container-fluid" id="main-para3">
            <p class="body">
                This is different from my presentation in which this only shows more of the basic notes and tid-bits of what it takes to develop. This was done intentionally so that my presentation is a little bit different and talks more about my experiences and other parts of web development that I wasn’t sure how to fit in.
